            <h2>Document and Website Structure</h2>
            <p>HTML allows you to mark up sections of content based on their meaning and structure. In addition to
                defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML also boasts a number
                of block level elements used to define areas of your website (such as "the header", "the navigation
                menu", "the main content column").</p>
            <p>Take some time to plan a basic website structure, and write the HTML to represent this structure. Basic
                sections of a document include the header, navigation, main content, and footer.</p>
            <p>Note: The appearance of the page shown here - including the layout, colors, and fonts - is achieved by
                applying CSS to the HTML. Once you have an understanding of the basics of HTML, try diving into our CSS
                first steps module to start learning how to style your site.</p>

            <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
            <p>HTML is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of
                sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and
                attributes. HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating static web pages</li>
                <li>Creating email templates</li>
                <li>Creating web applications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can't create dynamic
                functionality. It is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
                maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.</p>

            <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
            <p>An HTML opening tag is enclosed by a pair of angle brackets in the form of &lt;tag-name&gt; (e.g.,
                &lt;p&gt;, &lt;title&gt;), which is associated with a matching closing tag &lt;/tag-name&gt; having a
                leading forward slash, (e.g., &lt;/p&gt;, &lt;/title&gt;). The tag-name shall be in lowercase.</p>
            <p>Attributes, in the form of name="value" pairs can be included in the opening tag to provide additional
                information about the element. For example, in &lt;html lang="en"&gt;, the attribute lang="en" specifies
                the language of the document.</p>
            <p>You can use a &lt;link&gt; element to add an external CSS Style Sheet (and &lt;style&gt;...&lt;/style&gt;
                element for internal styles): &lt;link href="filename.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</p>
            <p>You can use a &lt;script&gt;...&lt;/script&gt; element to define programming scripts. For example, to add
                an external JavaScript file: &lt;script src="filename.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>
